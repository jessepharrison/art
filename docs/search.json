This led me to design several album covers and also music videos. More recently I have felt a shift in my approach, moving toward and through a wider range of topics and media to work with. The interest in photography remains, but there are also new areas to explore.\nThat shift also means there was a need for a complete reworking of my website to create room for new types of content. Spending some time to find a suitable tool for this, I was very happy to discover Quarto. As part of the process, I also reworked my other professional website using the same tool and linked both pages together.\nI’ve always preferred lightweight websites and feel this new version does a good job at featuring different kinds of content without sacrificing simplicity.

    "text": "What follows is a short photo story of an approximately 130-km journey I took with a friend through Sarek National Park (North Sweden) in August 2023. The route we took was a well-established one, starting from Ritsem (Änonjálmme), passing through Ruohtesvágge and Skárjá, winding over Snávvávágge and down into the Rapadalen.\nThere are many blog posts and books that discuss this route and others in a more matter-of-fact manner, so with this I instead wanted to dedicate space to impressions and feelings. For guidelines on planning a trip to Sarek there is, for example, a book by Karl-Johan Piehl that should come in handy. At the time of writing, there is both an English and Swedish edition, with the Swedish edition in particular including a wealth of information.\nAside from the entries below I did also want to write up a separate, more technically-focused entry on gear I used on this hike. That will follow later on."

The Västtopparna, Dubbeltoppen, Hambergs jökel. The mind settled for the road ahead, drinking in the surroundings. A well-trodden path lies ahead, a soft start to the day, warmth in the air despite the coming and going of clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking along this well-defined path, already longing to be further among the wilderness that lies ahead, beyond waymarked trails. Nearer the Kisuris Fjällstuga, a waypoint on the Padjelanta trail, the sense of being away grows a little stronger, turning in its sleep. A bridge across the milky grey-green Sjnjuvtjudisjåhkå and a turn off the trail, the sensation grows. Walking past the Sarek boundary, an invisible transition on the map, also comes with the physical sensation of entering into something new, home for the days to come. The feeling slowly opening its eyes, how long have I waited.\nRain moves through the valley, tents pitched not long before the Kisuriskåtan. Niják nearby and so the small ice field tucked within the side of Gisuris. On the next day the rain has cleared."

The warm rays of the sun are slowly hidden beneath a layer of grey that straddles the mountaintops, the movement of the wind made tangible in the appearance and disappearance of summits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appearance of Kantberget and Gavelberget, behind them lying the Nijákjiegna and vast Suottaisjiegŋa glacier that one can only picture in the mind’s eye while traversing the valley below.\nThe clouds taking on a heavier appearance, gathering mass and entailing rain to come. It is not soon before the rain begins to fall and the mountain pass changes hue. Feeding the body and the steps then lead downward to grey-black sand and the crossing of the glacial river Smájlajjåhkå. The river split into many streams, flowing fast, grey veins extending through the Ruohtesvágge valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the rain grows heavier, the journey continues over many smaller streams, until camp is made. The weather pattern looks set for the night and the day to follow.\nThis position of ours in Ruohtesvágge becomes a picture frame for the next day as the wind and rain gather pace. Strong gusts rattle the walls of the tent and the rainfall seems never-ending. Hearing each other in this weather is difficult and we spend a day sheltering from the weather. During short pauses it is possible to exchange a few words and plan the way ahead. Toward Snávvávágge and the dense Rapadalen, or a traverse of the high Luohttoláhko plateau? A choice is made to head toward Rapadalen.\nUltimately the storm passes, giving way to a dance of fire and ice in the sky, among the mountaintops. During these hours I have watched the same backdrop change countless times: Jållok, Vargtoppen, Gávabákte, Gavelberget in the distance, Boajsátjåhkkå on the other side of the valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe climb the mountainside to gather in the sunset unfolding ahead of us, a sense of relief as the weather lifts. If one is to believe the forecasts, tomorrow’s weather is looking much more promising for covering some further distance.\nThis concludes the first part of the story. For the second part, see here."

Passing Skárjá and the temporary summer bridge, taking in the severe power of the Mihkajåhkå river that drains the vast Mihkajiegna and fuses with Smájlajjåhkå, the land underneath cracked open by it. Here at the heart of Sarek also begins the Ráhpajåhkå, giving rise to Ráhpaädno and the Rapadalen river system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of us await two glacier outlets to ford, Máhtujågåsj and Tjåggŋårisjåhkå. Fed by the preceding day’s heavy rainfall, the latter is particularly formidable, a feeling of wonder filling the heart upon first encounter. Eventually a way is charted across the rapidly flowing water that has etched a way of its own into the land. The riverbed not being visible through the opaque water, the next step can only be gauged with the help of a walking pole, the stream being of such force to require pressing against it to make it through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the way continues past Bielajåhkå, another river crossing, and toward Bielavárásj. Although the way ahead is clear, we momentarily lose track and spend some time reorienting ourselves, pushing past waterlogged ground. As Bielavárásj is reached and some further elevation is gained, the mood lifts and we take refuge next to the hillside to feed ourselves. The top of Bielavárásj offers a windy view over the vast valley underneath, Ráhpajåhkå and its tributaries gleaming before us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the way continues along the side of Bielatjåhkkå. The old foothpath we are on, cutting across thickets of willow, is overrun by water, its sound our constant companion. Overlooking the great river below, leading to a green plateau before Spökstenen, an immediately recognisable boulder low in the valley underneath, rumoured to be haunted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path leading up to Snávvávágge is narrow and steeper than other sections on the trail, offering staggering views. Upon reaching the top of the narrow way leading up to an elevation close to 1000 metres, the landscape changes. Across the valley we catch a glimpse of the glaciers Jågåsjgaskajiegŋa and Oarjep Oalgásjjiegŋa. The thickets give way to open ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp on Snávvávágge lies what I may call my favourite part of the entire journey: the high-up, remote Snávvájávrre and its surroundings. Here the landscape is in marked contrast with the valleys below: grey, stone-laden, barren, hiding silent secrets. Setting up camp for the night here, time feels lost in another world, we climb up to the ledge to watch the rapidly shifting cloud formations over Stuor Skoarkki. Nearby a waterfall flows directly into a hollow in the ground and underneath the massive boulder field the flow of water is audible. If only one knew where this water flows.\nI captured several images that night on Snávvávágge, which I look forward to sharing with you in the next chapter.\nThis concludes the second part. See here for the third part."

    "text": "Day 4 (continued): Snávvávágge\nAs mentioned in the third chapter of this photo story, Snávvávágge and its surroundings were perhaps my favourite part of the entire route leading from Ruohtesvágge to Rapadalen, and from there on to Skierfe. Why so? Not an easy question to answer, but there was a certain silent feeling of power to the landscape here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lake Snávvájávrre, in particular, struck a chord with me and filled me with a certain feeling of arrival and familiarity. On its shores I could feel memories of times already gone and of past adventures in different lands, possibly also of journeys that are yet to come.\nThe human mind is such an odd thing, filled with places and symbols that lie dormant until some external encounter brings them to surface. At this point I was indeed quite deep already in my head and the entire way up to Snávvávágge had been brimming with sudden thoughts along the lines of: “Am I dreaming? Am I dying? Is this another world I have just come into?”. The surface of the lake offered but a shimmer in response, stirred by the wind that this place must be so well-acquainted with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitching our tents by the lake brought my thoughts back to practicalities and soon, once our camp was ready, we set off to explore the surroundings. It was not long until the feeling of mystery returned upon finding a large waterfall that drained directly into the ground below. The land here is dotted by boulders, rocks and scree of various sizes and descriptions, under which the water flowed, either into the streams further below or somewhere only known by the elements themselves, black and deep as the wall of stone behind the waterfall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing a boulder field in the dimming light, we arrive at the ledge overlooking Rapadalen. The view back toward Snávvájávrre, its hues now blue and wrapped in the colour of the clouds above, felt like the unlocking of another undeciphered symbol hidden within. Something unraveled and disappeared, or rather merely changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning back to face Rapadalen, dark clouds were swirling above Stuor Skoarkki, the colours of the night now watching us as we stood on the ledge. Tomorrow we would take this way down to the dense Rapa valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes the third part. See here for part four."

    "text": "Day 5: Rapadalen\n19km, 752m ascent\nFollowing a descent between Stuor Skoarkki and Låddebákte, the stream Jilájåhkå is crossed. In contrast with the preceding days, today is warm, bordering on hot, very few clouds in the sky.\nThe traverse through the densely vegetated Rapadalen is arduous and time-consuming, and not to be underestimated. Opting to find the lower path that cuts across the waterside, we enter a network of passages that is often submerged in ankle-deep water. Soon we are nearly up to our waists in a sulphurous marsh, pushing past snarling willows, the heat of the sun above us.\nMovement here is slow and at times I find myself thinking of nightmares and feverish hallucinations. My friend loses his trekking pole in the murky water, luckily rediscovered after a period of frantic searching. The ground becomes easier to move through once the lower path is found, but here the river channels are also waist-deep at times. After a misplaced step I take a plunge in a large deposit of soft, grey silt, landing on my back: a practical reminder that we are, after all, walking through a massive river basin. Looking back at photos from this part of the trip, they all look deceptively unassuming, even inviting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking our way through the labyrinth of forest paths, we eventually come across Alep Vássjájågåsj. The stream is split into two and after crossing the second tributary, a path leading up to higher ground can be found. Locating this path is essential if wishing to move higher up. Not the first time on this trip, a sense of relief fills us as we begin moving up and away from the jungle-like valley and reach Vássjálåpptå.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the traverse is easy. As described in prior entries, an easy crossing point over Lulep Vássjájågåsj can be found at 970m, this number already scribbled onto my map before setting foot into Sarek. A further crossing is made over the stream flowing from Rådnik and we search the rocky ground for suitable spots to pitch our tents. From here there are wide-ranging views into the valley underlying us, draped in twilight, and the chain of mountains safeguarding it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting camp, large-horned reindeer accompany us as we climb over a nearby summit to watch the landscape underneath us. A small ascent is enough for the vast river system to reveal more of itself. It has been a tough day, on the way back to the tent I can feel the tiredness reach into my bones as the moonlight shines over a still pond nearby. Lying still in my tent, I can hear the reindeer grazing within a few metres’ distance outside, the calming sound of their bells in the almost windless night."

I fire up my stove and boil some ripe pu’er, water from the nearby stream tastes very pure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here on, we take the route over the mountain plateaus toward Skierfe and Aktse, passing Suorkitjåhkkå and the north side of Gierdogiesjtjåhkkå. On its side lies a vast boulder field and a treacherous-looking snowbridge over the nameless stream cutting between it and Suorkisjnjnurttje. The plain underneath seems mind-boggling in its emptiness.\nThe way to Skierfe is quickly made and we visit the top to capture another view of the Rapadalen. The views on top are vertigo-inducing. Here and on the way in I am already processing the feeling of heading back to the heavily frequented paths of the Kungsleden, which we follow all the way to Saltoluokta. There are several people on Skierfe and it is here that I also stop taking more photos of the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn these days, additional twists to the way home are brought up in the form of norovirus cases rapidly spreading south from Kebnekaise, prompting closure of all fjällstations on the way. We hear that many sick travellers have been lifted off the trail by helicopter and of how Storm Hans, the strongest storm encountered in over two decades, was predicted to directly pass over North Sweden. One can only imagine how this would have been, but ultimately the storm passed through South Sweden instead, bringing much destruction to lower parts of the country. Thankfully we managed to make our way back safely and in good health! On the bright side of things, dinner is still served at Saltoluokta and is excellent as always, a rewarding way to mark the end of this through-hike."

    "text": "Gear analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee here for my lighterpack gear list for this trip. My starting weight including food and water was about 11.5 kg, with a base weight of around 6.4 kg.\nWhile an item-by-item analysis would seem like a major effort (and also of limited interest), below are some thoughts on individual pieces of gear I brought along. Note that these are personal views, I have received zero gear sponsorship and am merely writing this as someone with a life-long love for hiking.\nIf you’d like to chat about any other gear that’s on my pack list but not mentioned below, just reach out. You can get a hold of me through both Instagram or email, always happy to talk!\n\nCarry gear\nThe ZPacks Arc Haul Ultra 60 felt like the right choice for trip. This rucksack is very comfortable for carrying slightly heavier loads. My only negative experience so far is that I’ve had to reinforce some of the seams (e.g. near the stitching of the outer mesh) with some DCF repair patches. These clearly stood out as weak points even before starting to use the pack, but with some care have held up well.\nIt is challenging to find another rucksack with a frame and load lifters at this weight point (~600 g). I have opted for some extra features (extra padding on the lower back, waist and shoulder strap pouches) that bring the total weight to 690 g. The additions have seemed like a good way to go.\n\n\nDurston X-Mid Pro 2 tent (2022 version)\nDespite its low (~600g) weight, this single-layer DCF tent held well when faced with storm-force winds and seemingly endless heavy rain on Ruohtesvágge. In bad conditions, extra stakes and a good pitch are necessary. Laying rocks over the stakes also made for some extra confidence (important for a decent night’s sleep!). For my next Sarek trip I may nevertheless consider a smaller one-person tent.\nCondensation control was excellent with everything considered, it was enough to give the walls a light wipe before packing away the tent. It never felt like condensation was a problem. The DCF walls are remarkably good at keeping water out.\nThe two-person version of this tent makes for a roomy feeling when solo camping and the extra space came in handy for drying wet gear. Tent spots were usually easy to find on this route, even for this larger tent. The only exception was on the mountains overlooking Rapadalen after crossing Lulep Vássjájågåsj. There the ground is very rocky and I ended up sleeping on some quite sloped ground.\nI’m one of those overly careful people who prefer to use a separate groundsheet, for this I used a MYOG Tyvek sheet made of the softer 1443R variant.\nAs with all X-Mid models, this tent needs two poles to pitch. It packs down into a small space and fits well inside the Arc Haul.\n\n\n\nAstral TR1 Mesh trainers\nI was looking for something that would handle constantly wet conditions well and these trainers definitely delivered on that front. Paired with Darn Tough Micro Crew UL running socks, water drained very quickly from the feet after stream and river crossings, and my feet stayed in good condition despite being wet for practically the entire duration of the trip. The thin mesh construction means these trainers dry very fast. Another plus to mention is the very good traction, even when going up and down boulder fields. The shoes fit true to size, although they start off feeling a bit tight and require wearing-in before being put to real use.\nJust a few downsides, the first being that these shoes are hard to find in Europe. I ended up ordering them from outside the EU and therefore had to pay a customs fee. On sandy terrain the lugholes on the front let in small debris. In most of Sarek this is not a problem, but e.g. after fording glacier streams it was necessary to give the shoes a rinse to remove any gravel that entered. Another issue is that the lack of ankle support may be problematic on some routes. The last two days of this trip involved some ascending and descenging over quite steep scree and my ankles ended up swelling a bit as a result, despite having worn barefoot shoes for years.\nSarek took a bit of a toll on these shoes, but in my experience they are of quite good durability. Some of the gluing on the front lip came loose, nothing a bit of shoe gloe can’t fix. The mesh material on the outside had a good few scrapes against sharp scree and boulders, but did not rip. Some wear and tear, but still functional.\nAll in all, great trainers, clearly designed to handle wet terrain. I can see these becoming a staple item on future trips, including further visits to Sarek. I would not wear Gore-Tex footwear to Sarek, as they do not drain water well or dry quickly enough.\n\n\n\nRain equipment\nFor this trip, I brought along two pieces of rain gear: a waterproof shell jacket (Inov-8 Raceshell Pro) and a DCF rain kilt by Gear Swifts. Both performed well and pack into almost nothing. Under this category I’d be tempted to add that the combination of running tights and shorts was ideal for Sarek and at times this combination of legwear would dry so quickly in the wind that I ended up questioning the need for a separate rain kilt. However, the kilt did save me from wet underpants on a couple of occasions, which made for extra comfort.\nI have replaced the original attachments that came with the rain kilt with a solution of my own (that seems somehow easier to use), but can easily recommend both pieces of rain gear.\nA quick word about the jacket still: at the time of writing the price seems to vary between outlets, if you’re not in a rush it’s worth spending some time hunting for deals.\n\n\n\nWarm-up gear\nA synthetic puffy jacket (Enlightened Equipment Torrid Apex) was much appreciated on this journey, particularly during the nights when huddled up in my tent and when having a wander around campsites. The jacket also made for a comfortable pillow when it was warm enough to sleep without the jacket on. I have toyed with the idea of substituting the puffy with a couple of Polartec Alpha layers for a small weight saving, but so far have not tried this. If anyone has experiences of this, I’d be interested in hearing them.\nWearing the puffy underneath a G1000 overshirt feels incredibly wind-proof and warm. I used this combination to do some brief climbs up to mountain ledges after setting camp.\nA merino net shirt (Aclima Woolnet Light) was an ideal underlayer for this trip. Warm when it needed to be, not overheating when the sun was out, quick-drying.\nI have become a big fan of Polartec Alpha as a mid-layer, so breathable and warm. This fabric needs a lot of babying, however (it will easily catch on e.g. velcro or vegetation). It is a must to combine it with a tough outer layer for any bushwhacking sections, such as in the Rapadalen, otherwise any clothing made of this delicate fabric would quickly become damaged.\nHaving a separate, “sleep only” fleece beanie was a good idea for times when it was necessary to pitch a tent in the pouring rain. This made it possible to leave my wet hat drying on the outside and pull out a dry one once inside the tent. Sometimes I wondered how necessary this was, but on very wet nights it always made life easier.\n\n\n\nUnused gear\n\nIce axe and microspikes\nI brought these items along as a just-in-case, in the event of choosing to cross the high-elevation Luohttoláhko plateau or any larger snow fields. As a decision was made to take the route through Snávvávágge and Rapadalen instead, this gear was not needed. However, given the relatively light weight of the Petzl Ride ice axe and Black Diamond Blitz microspikes (365g in total), this was not much of a bother. In case there is any possibility that the hike might involve walking over extensive snow fields, I’d rather accept the weight penalty over regretting the absence of safety gear.\n\n\nHead torch\nI took this along despite knowing that I’d very likely not use it, given that early to mid-August in North Sweden is light enough to make do without one. Somehow the darker evenings in South Finland ended up playing with my mind … not next time! Although I would still take one along for trips starting later in August or in September.\n\n\nWaterproof mittens\nMy OMM Core fleece mitts stayed warm enough even when wet to be worn without their accompanying waterproof shells (OMM Kamleika), despite the rain, wind and cold. Nevertheless, the Kamleikas only weigh some 30g, so there was little reason to leave them home. Under colder conditions they could also provide extra warmth for summit trips or time spent in the tent.\n\n\n\nWrapping up\nPlanning the gear list for this trip took several months. While some items could have been left home to further reduce the weight, I never felt my pack weight was excessive (even with the additional mountain gear included). Nevertheless, I got some useful fine-tuning ideas for future trips, including further visits to Sarek.\nThanks for reading, hope you found the contents useful!"
