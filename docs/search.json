    "text": "It was then I knew the beginning of something new…\n\n\nFor many years, my interest in creating visual art was strongly focused on landscape and nature photography, often with some musical inspiration. This led me to design several album covers and also music videos. More recently I have felt a shift in my approach, moving toward and through a wider range of topics and media to work with. The interest in photography remains, but there are also new areas to explore.\nThat shift also means there was a need for a complete reworking of my website to create room for new types of content. Spending some time to find a suitable tool for this, I was very happy to discover Quarto. As part of the process, I also reworked my other professional website using the same tool and linked both pages together.\nI’ve always preferred lightweight websites and feel this new version does a good job at featuring different kinds of content without sacrificing simplicity. I hope you feel the same and enjoy browsing!"

    "text": "What follows is a short photo story of an approximately 130-km journey I took with a friend through Sarek National Park (North Sweden) in August 2023. The route we took was a well-established one, starting from Ritsem (Änonjálmme), passing through Ruohtesvágge and Skárjá, winding over Snávvávágge and down into the Rapadalen.\nThere are many blog posts and books that discuss this route and others in a more matter-of-fact manner, so with this I instead wanted to dedicate space to impressions and feelings. For guidelines on planning a trip to Sarek there is, for example, a book by Karl-Johan Piehl that should come in handy. At the time of writing, there is both an English and Swedish edition, with the Swedish edition in particular including a wealth of information.\nAside from the entries below I did also want to write up a separate, more technically-focused entry on gear I used on this hike. That will follow later on."

The Västtopparna, Dubbeltoppen, Hambergs jökel. The mind settled for the road ahead, drinking in the surroundings. A well-trodden path lies ahead, a soft start to the day, warmth in the air despite the coming and going of clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking along this well-defined path, already longing to be further among the wilderness that lies ahead, beyond waymarked trails. Nearer the Kisuris Fjällstuga, a waypoint on the Padjelanta trail, the sense of being away grows a little stronger, turning in its sleep. A bridge across the milky grey-green Sjnjuvtjudisjåhkå and a turn off the trail, the sensation grows. Walking past the Sarek boundary, an invisible transition on the map, also comes with the physical sensation of entering into something new, home for the days to come. The feeling slowly opening its eyes, how long have I waited.\nRain moves through the valley, tents pitched not long before the Kisuriskåtan. Niják nearby and so the small ice field tucked within the side of Gisuris. On the next day the rain has cleared."

    "text": "Days 2-3: Ruohtesvágge\n18.7km, 375m ascent\nSlowly the valleys begin to deepen and the landscape grows. The morning rays give way to growing cloud. The warm rays of the sun are slowly hidden beneath a layer of grey that straddles the mountaintops, the movement of the wind made tangible in the appearance and disappearance of summits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appearance of Kantberget and Gavelberget, behind them lying the Nijákjiegna and vast Suottaisjiegŋa glacier that one can only picture in the mind’s eye while traversing the valley below.\nThe clouds taking on a heavier appearance, gathering mass and entailing rain to come. It is not soon before the rain begins to fall and the mountain pass changes hue. Feeding the body and the steps then lead downward to grey-black sand and the crossing of the glacial river Smájlajjåhkå. The river split into many streams, flowing fast, grey veins extending through the Ruohtesvágge valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the rain grows heavier, the journey continues over many smaller streams, until camp is made. The weather pattern looks set for the night and the day to follow.\nThis position of ours in Ruohtesvágge becomes a picture frame for the next day as the wind and rain gather pace. Strong gusts rattle the walls of the tent and the rainfall seems never-ending. Hearing each other in this weather is difficult and we spend a day sheltering from the weather. During short pauses it is possible to exchange a few words and plan the way ahead. Toward Snávvávágge and the dense Rapadalen, or a traverse of the high Luohttoláhko plateau? A choice is made to head toward Rapadalen.\nUltimately the storm passes, giving way to a dance of fire and ice in the sky, among the mountaintops. During these hours I have watched the same backdrop change countless times: Jållok, Vargtoppen, Gávabákte, Gavelberget in the distance, Boajsátjåhkkå on the other side of the valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe climb the mountainside to gather in the sunset unfolding ahead of us, a sense of relief as the weather lifts. If one is to believe the forecasts, tomorrow’s weather is looking much more promising for covering some further distance.\nThis concludes the first part of the story. For the second part, see here."

    "text": "Day 4: Continuing from Ruohtesvágge to Snávvávágge\n21.1km, 586m ascent\nFrom here on the weather was in our favour, with only the occasional rain shower passing over us. Passing Skárjá and the temporary summer bridge, taking in the severe power of the Mihkajåhkå river that drains the vast Mihkajiegna and fuses with Smájlajjåhkå, the land underneath cracked open by it. Here at the heart of Sarek also begins the Ráhpajåhkå, giving rise to Ráhpaädno and the Rapadalen river system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of us await two glacier outlets to ford, Máhtujågåsj and Tjåggŋårisjåhkå. Fed by the preceding day’s heavy rainfall, the latter is particularly formidable, a feeling of wonder filling the heart upon first encounter. Eventually a way is charted across the rapidly flowing water that has etched a way of its own into the land. The riverbed not being visible through the opaque water, the next step can only be gauged with the help of a walking pole, the stream being of such force to require pressing against it to make it through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the way continues past Bielajåhkå, another river crossing, and toward Bielavárásj. Although the way ahead is clear, we momentarily lose track and spend some time reorienting ourselves, pushing past waterlogged ground. As Bielavárásj is reached and some further elevation is gained, the mood lifts and we take refuge next to the hillside to feed ourselves. The top of Bielavárásj offers a windy view over the vast valley underneath, Ráhpajåhkå and its tributaries gleaming before us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the way continues along the side of Bielatjåhkkå. The old foothpath we are on, cutting across thickets of willow, is overrun by water, its sound our constant companion. Overlooking the great river below, leading to a green plateau before Spökstenen, an immediately recognisable boulder low in the valley underneath, rumoured to be haunted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path leading up to Snávvávágge is narrow and steeper than other sections on the trail, offering staggering views. Upon reaching the top of the narrow way leading up to an elevation close to 1000 metres, the landscape changes. Across the valley we catch a glimpse of the glaciers Jågåsjgaskajiegŋa and Oarjep Oalgásjjiegŋa. The thickets give way to open ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp on Snávvávágge lies what I may call my favourite part of the entire journey: the high-up, remote Snávvájávrre and its surroundings. Here the landscape is in marked contrast with the valleys below: grey, stone-laden, barren, hiding silent secrets. Setting up camp for the night here, time feels lost in another world, we climb up to the ledge to watch the rapidly shifting cloud formations over Stuor Skoarkki. Nearby a waterfall flows directly into a hollow in the ground and underneath the massive boulder field the flow of water is audible. If only one knew where this water flows.\nI captured several images that night on Snávvávágge, which I look forward to sharing with you in the next chapter.\nThis concludes the second part. See here for the third part."

    "text": "Day 4 (continued): Snávvávágge\nAs mentioned in the third chapter of this photo story, Snávvávágge and its surroundings were perhaps my favourite part of the entire route leading from Ruohtesvágge to Rapadalen, and from there on to Skierfe. Why so? Not an easy question to answer, but there was a certain silent feeling of power to the landscape here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lake Snávvájávrre, in particular, struck a chord with me and filled me with a certain feeling of arrival and familiarity. On its shores I could feel memories of times already gone and of past adventures in different lands, possibly also of journeys that are yet to come.\nThe human mind is such an odd thing, filled with places and symbols that lie dormant until some external encounter brings them to surface. At this point I was indeed quite deep already in my head and the entire way up to Snávvávágge had been brimming with sudden thoughts along the lines of: “Am I dreaming? Am I dying? Is this another world I have just come into?”. The surface of the lake offered but a shimmer in response, stirred by the wind that this place must be so well-acquainted with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitching our tents by the lake brought my thoughts back to practicalities and soon, once our camp was ready, we set off to explore the surroundings. It was not long until the feeling of mystery returned upon finding a large waterfall that drained directly into the ground below. The land here is dotted by boulders, rocks and scree of various sizes and descriptions, under which the water flowed, either into the streams further below or somewhere only known by the elements themselves, black and deep as the wall of stone behind the waterfall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing a boulder field in the dimming light, we arrive at the ledge overlooking Rapadalen. The view back toward Snávvájávrre, its hues now blue and wrapped in the colour of the clouds above, felt like the unlocking of another undeciphered symbol hidden within. Something unraveled and disappeared, or rather merely changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning back to face Rapadalen, dark clouds were swirling above Stuor Skoarkki, the colours of the night now watching us as we stood on the ledge. Tomorrow we would take this way down to the dense Rapa valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes the third part. Part four will soon follow!"
