    "text": "It was then I knew the beginning of something new…\n\n\nFor many years, my interests in creating art was strongly focused on landscape photography, often guided through the lends of music. This led me to design several album covers and also music videos. However, more recently I have felt something of a shift in my approach, moving toward and through a wider range of materials and media to work with. The interest in photography remains, but there are also new areas to explore.\nThat shift also means there was a need for a complete rehaul of my website to create room for new types of content. Spending some time to find a suitable tool for this, I was very happy to discover Quarto. During this process, I also reworked my other professional website using the same template and linked both pages together.\nI’ve always preferred lightweight websites and feel this new version does a good job at featuring different kinds of content without sacrificing simplicity. I hope you feel the same and enjoy browsing!"
