#### **Biography**

I work as a freelance artist with a focus on nature photography, traditional kintsugi / gintsugi repairs and short poems. My art is mostly inspired by my interest in hiking, music and tea.

My photos are available as Alu-Dibond prints. For quotes, please email me.

#### **Kintsugi / gintsugi repairs**

Repairs are available upon request. I only use natural, food-safe raw materials (urushi, tonoko, gold and silver). When requesting a quote, please also send me photos of the broken item(s).

#### **Further details**

Aside from art, I work as a Senior Data Scientist and Project Manager at [CSC - IT Center for Science](https://www.csc.fi/en/). More on this on [my other website](https://jessepharrison.github.io/).
