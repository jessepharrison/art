*It was then I knew the beginning of something new...*

For many years, my interest in creating visual art was strongly focused on
landscape and nature photography, often with some musical inspiration. This led
me to design several album covers and also music videos. More recently I have 
felt a shift in my approach, moving toward and through a wider  range of topics
and media to work with. The interest in photography remains, but there are also
new areas to explore.

That shift also means there was a need for a complete reworking of my website to
create room for new types of content. Spending some time to find a suitable tool
for this, I was very happy to discover [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). As part of
the process, I also reworked my [other professional website](https://jessepharrison.github.io/) 
using the same tool and linked both pages together.

I've always preferred lightweight websites and feel this new version does a good
job at featuring different kinds of content without sacrificing simplicity. I
hope you feel the same and enjoy browsing!
